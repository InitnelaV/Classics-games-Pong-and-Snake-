PONG V2.0

An update to Pong making it more realistic: 

There's a maximum speed limit for the ballâ€”when it went too fast, it would go through the paddle.

The randomization of the ball's trajectory.

Finally, I also tweaked the AI's margin of error (so it's actually possible to win ;) )

Two classics, Pong and Snake, with Pong not debugged, among the first 'complex' scripts i modified. 


!!!!!!!!! Scripts that I modified from an existing base; I am not the original owner of the code. I customized these ones !!!!!!!!!
